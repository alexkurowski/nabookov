# KOOB|FEED

A platform/market place for writers to sell their work as it is being written.
"Patreon" or "Early Access" for writers.


## Repository notes

* Root folder name is supposed to be `app`, but koobfeed might work just fine.


### Ideas

Keep track of users and try to determine if they are a writer or a reader

Govern covers of books manually to avoid bad pictures

Check novel section of pixiv.net

Get cool big icons to assign to books based on genres, sizes and stuff

Writing machine icon

Max-width: 710px ?

Allow users to set a typeface for each novel they author.
Allow users to override typeface settings on :cog: settings page.
"You know best how you like to read your novels"
