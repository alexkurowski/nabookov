# NABOOKOV

A platform/market place for writers to sell their work as it is being written.
"Patreon" or "Early Access" for writers.

Nabookov is better than anything on the market, because it aims to improve on
reading and writing experience, and keep clutter away. Improved design and
ability to buy books directly from authors is what sets nabookov.com apart
from the similar platforms.
